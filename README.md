# Turnkey Software Engineering Assessment

Welcome to my Turnkey Software Engineering Assessment repository! This repository contains my solutions for the assessment tasks provided by Turnkey Africa Ltd.

## Tasks

### FibonacciGenerator.java

This file contains a Java program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The program asks the user for input, validates it, and prints the Fibonacci sequence. It includes error handling, modular structure, and optimization techniques for efficient sequence generation.

### LargestDifference.java

In this file, I have implemented a Java function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the list. The function handles input lists of any size, accounts for duplicates, and returns 0 if the list has less than two elements. It is well-structured with meaningful variable names and comments for clarity.

### EmployeeQuery.sql

This file contains an SQL query that selects all employees whose age is above 30 and salary is above $50,000 from the "employees" database table. The query is optimized for performance and ensures clarity and readability.

### AverageCalculator.java

The `AverageCalculator.java` file holds a Java class with a function to calculate the average of an array of integers. It accounts for edge cases such as an empty or null array and returns the average with double precision. The code is well-documented, modular, and includes a demonstration in the main method.

## Instructions

To access each file's code, simply navigate to the respective file in the repository. Each file is well-commented and includes a brief description at the beginning to explain its purpose and functionality.

## Test

You can run the code for each task individually. For `FibonacciGenerator.java` and `AverageCalculator.java`, you can execute the main method to see the results of the calculations.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reviewing my solutions to the Turnkey Software Engineering Assessment tasks. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me. I hope you find my solutions well-structured, efficient, and meeting the evaluation criteria.

Best regards,
Melvin Senelwa.
